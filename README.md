# Quiz Time!

This repo is for a small sample AngularJS project I created for a code sample.

This was made using the
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
AngularJS generator. I customized it to use HAML for views and coffeescript for Jasmine test files.

Took me about 3 days working for a few hours each day in between normal work.
